# Requirement

You must change the cabling. Follow the explanation located here:

https://www.iot-experiments.com/dagoma-discoeasy200/ (Marlin v1.1.8 + original cabling -- not the one did by Dagoma) 

# Issue

Improvement for the move and probe on the plate need to be done since the head is different from the original one.
